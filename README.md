##Introduction
<p>This summary includes an implementation of "Sunset in Village” that makes use of a collection of OpenGL functions. 
The project is divided into five scenes. The first scene only depicts the sun. Which is stable and does not move, however if we use function keys, 
it moves. The second scene will depict a moving cloud in the sky. The third scene depicts a school and dwellings in the ground. 
A car is traveling down the road in the fourth scene, while a boat is moving into the river in the fifth shot. 
User interactivity is given by allowing the user to move the car faster and change system direction by pressing alphabetical keys. 
The user can use the alphabetical keys to stop and start the boat, as well as to control the sun up and down mechanism. 
The GLUT Functions drown these five objects.</p>
