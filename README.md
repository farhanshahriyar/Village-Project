## Introduction
<p>This summary includes an implementation of "Sunset in Village” that makes use of a collection of OpenGL functions. 
The project is divided into five scenes. The first scene only depicts the sun. Which is stable and does not move, however if we use function keys, 
it moves. The second scene will depict a moving cloud in the sky. The third scene depicts a school and dwellings in the ground. 
A car is traveling down the road in the fourth scene, while a boat is moving into the river in the fifth shot. 
User interactivity is given by allowing the user to move the car faster and change system direction by pressing alphabetical keys. 
The user can use the alphabetical keys to stop and start the boat, as well as to control the sun up and down mechanism. 
The GLUT Functions drown these five objects.</p>

## Objective
<p>
•	Understanding how the OpenGL library works is essential. <br>
•	Using the library function, we created this 2D project. <br>
•	Making items out of fundamental forms. <br>
•	Understanding the logics that will be used to move the objects in the project. <br>

## Objective
<p>This summary includes an implementation of "Sunset in Village” that makes use of a collection of OpenGL functions. 
The project is divided into five scenes. The first scene only depicts the sun. Which is stable and does not move, however if we use function keys, 
it moves. The second scene will depict a moving cloud in the sky. The third scene depicts a school and dwellings in the ground.

The user can use the alphabetical keys to stop and start the boat, as well as to control the sun up and down mechanism. 
The GLUT Functions drown these five objects.</p>

## Library Function 
<p>
•	All OpenGL library functions begin with the letters gl and capitalize words . <br>
•	example functions:<br>
•	 glClear , glClearColor , and code :glVertex2f  .<br>
•	 The OpenGL library provides a powerful but primitive set of rendering commands. Higher level libraries provide additional functionality.<br>
</p>

## Software Requirement
<p>
•	Programming Language : C++ <br>
•	OS : Windows <br>
•	Graphics Library : GL/glut.h <br>
•	OpenGL <br>
</p>
  
  
 ## Conclusion
  <p>We attempted to create and implement "Sunset in Village." OpenGL allows for a great deal of flexibility in the creation and use of OpenGL graphics programs. The presence of several built-in classes methods handles a lot of functionality, which reduces coding and simplifies implementation. We implemented the project in such a way that it is as user-friendly and error-free as feasible. We apologize for any mistakes that may have occurred inadvertently.</p>
